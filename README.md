# How to write a script in VBA to manipulate input data form excel, calculate and display output data :cd:

Hello, in this project we will learn how to use VBA to  loop throught all the stock for one year and output useful data

# what we will learn from this project

    - How to declare and use the right variables
    - How to use the right instructions: data emtry, condition, iteration, and data display
    - How to call predefined functions
    - How to call created functions
    - How to apply the same code in several sheets
    
# Instruction
    -The ticker symbol: the symbol of each ticker without redundancy
    - Yearly change = opening price at the beginning of a given year - closing price at the end of that year
    - The percentage change = (yearly change/ opening price at the beginning of the year)*100
    - The total stock volume = sum of the stock volume of each ticker
    - Greatest % increase: the maximum of percentage change
    - Greatest % decrease: the minimum of purcentage change
    - Greates total volume: the biggest total stock volume

# Software used

```Main function
'initialize a counter to save the position of the bigenning of the first ticker

        total_stock = total_stock + Cells(i + 1, 7).Value
        
    Else

        'add the ticker in the cell(k,9)
        
        Cells(k, 9).Value = Cells(i, 1).Value

call greatest
